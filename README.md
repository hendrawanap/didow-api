## About The Project
Didow app is our final project for Bangkit 2022 program graduation requirement. Didow helps kids with dyslexia to learn to read and write in a fun way. With Didow, we will try to improve the learning progress and provides affordable assessment and treatment for children with dyslexia.

Here's why:

- There are still rarely free applications that develop treatments for dyslexic children in Indonesia.
- Of the 50 million school children in Indonesia, 5 million of them suffer from this disorder.

## Things That Provided By The API:
- Generate exercise's questions based on selected type
- Analyze assessment result
- Adjusting exercise's difficulty
- Save dan analyze exercise history
- Give recommendation based on user's progress
- As a middleware between the mobile app and the machine learning part
